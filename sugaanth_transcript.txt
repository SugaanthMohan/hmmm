Introduction:
==============
Thank you Manoj! 

Greetings Everyone, This is Sugaanth and I will be explaining the slides on Regression Models and Auto-ML.


Regression Models:
===================

So, when we moved away from statistical& Traditional models and towards Regression models Initially , 
we started expirementing with multiple models 
including XGBoost, KNN Regression, Lasso Regression and Random Forest Regression, 
- We created features based on time series and historical feature expansion using sliding window conversions.
• We also used feature importance to remove lesser significant features and keep the relevant features in place.
• Our initial models such as XGBoost, and Lasso Regression were only able to capture only certain aspects of the trend.
• later through visualization and analysis, We found that the tree based models were able to make better predictions, 
and random forest model was the best optimal model.

• So, The shortcomings of Random Forest Model was that
 - There was no fixed set of hyper parameters for the model.
 - Overall performance (average) was good, the peaks and lows were blunt and were not predicted accurately.


Hence, we needed a more dynamic solution and  we went with AutoML.

AutoML Model:
=============
• Automated machine learning (AutoML) uses a higher-level approach to handle machine learning task.
• Our current approach, TPOT leverages on Genetic Programming Algorithm (GPA), which is stochastic in nature, 
to automate the search for possible ML pipelines.
• what this means is that contrary to grid search, we get different results each time we run tpot.
• We were also able to significantly reduce the research/coding time, deliver pipelines faster and also have an approach that can be reused anywhere.

• And also our approach is also highly configurable, which means we can select the  broad range of models with 
inclusions/exclusions on preprocessors, feature selection techniques, estimators or transformer with customizations.

• And we also have GPA based configurable variables, 
• These customizations which i mentioned at the end, are the essence of making the Auto-ML work, and it has various parameters such as 
	- Generations - which is the number of generations/iterations to be run.
	- Population size - which is the total generated ML pipelines per generation.
	- Number of Tests - which is the total number of times a pipeline is fitted with data and selecting the best pipeline out of those iterations.
	- Max Evaluation Time- how long a particular pipeline is allowed to fit before force-failing.
	- off spring size - No. of offsprings produced in each generation.
	- mutation rate - how many pipelines to apply random changes

• And the final nth generation model will contain a stacking estimator with all the best models fitted from each generation.




And my colleage will aditya will be presenting the deck for LSTM Neural Network
